// __________________________________________
// Reflection
/*
What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?

I learned a new way of doing it, having never used a for...in loop before. I think that this was a cool way of accessing specific keys in JS which I had never thought of before, and adds a new dimension to accessing nested objects that I don't know an equivalent for in Ruby. The real challenge is knowing what you are accessing through which call.

Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?

Yes, for starters, the for...in loop. If we had known to use that right away, it would have saved my partner and I over an hour of work. Also, being able to use ++ rather than establishing a separate counter when incrementing an object is so nice.

What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
JavaScript syntax in general, accessing nested valued in JavaScript, the for...in loop.
