###What is a one-to-one database?

A one to one database is a database that contains information for which there is only one object that relates to only one other object. For instance, a country can't have more than one capital, a country (probably) does not have more than one head of state. You are relating one object in terms of its relationship to anohter object, for which there is no subjectivity and there is only one answer.

###When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

If you are managing data that only relates to one thing, like keeping track of ID numbers, state capitals, etc. This is not practical for subjective data like favorites, nor things that a thing can have more than one of (like an address, a car, a pet, etc)

###What is a many-to-many database?

Many to many databases relate a group of data that relates broadly to another group of data. This allows more room for subjectivity and variety, because these types of datasets have many possibilites.

###When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

Trying to relate one data set to another set of data, wherein there may be multiple answers. These two sets don't belong exclusively to one another and there is a lot of room for variety. I can see this being helpful for a college campus, wherein classes contain many students and students are also taking many different classes.

###What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?

I'm having trouble contextualizing all of the relationships right now. The examples given make sense, but I'm not sure exactly how I'll use them myself. I imagine that figuring out the relationship between the data sets is the first step, because then you know how it is orgainzed, one to many, many to many, or one to one. I imagine more practice will clarify everything. Also, I found the schema creation website to be anything but intutitive. It took me a long time to figure out how to make things the way I wanted them to be.
