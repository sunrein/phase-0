How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Using DevTools is a much quicker way to inspect elements and how they change things on the page because the changes happen immediately on the page on which you are working. If working exclusively in Sublime, it would be much slower to check the results of each change. It is also helpful to look at other websites and what their code looks like for ideas and a better understanding of what elements do.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You can change width and height using pixels, ems, etc.

What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute - will go exactly where you want it to go, regardless of the position of other elements.
Fixed - stays in the same place even when the site is scrolled, and is controlled by top, bottom, right, left
Static - is default and is not affected by left, right, top, and bottom directions
Relative - positioned relative to it's default position, and can be moved by left, right, top and bottom

What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

Margin is the outermost layer, padding is the innermost layer, and border is in between.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

This challenge was frustrating at times, because I did not have a lot of knowledge about positioning before. Codeacademy is sometimes hard to learn from because they give you most of the answers upfront, so I didn't feel like I had retained a lot of what was taught there. However, it did feel extremely satisfying when we were able to troubleshoot, research, and then solve problems together.
