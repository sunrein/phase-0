What does puts do?

Puts prints the result of a program to the console with a new line, but returns nil.

What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number, no decimal points. A float is short for a floating-point-number, also known as a decimal.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division does not include any decimals. Therefore, all products will be whole numbers, with the remainders dropped. Float division includes decimals, also known as the remainder, in the answer. For instance, in integer division 15/2 would equal 7, becasue the remainder is not included. In float division, 15/2 equals 7.5, because float division includes the remainder.


Pseudocode:
Hours in a day = 24
Days in a year= 365

```ruby
Hours_in_a_year = 24*365
puts 24*365
```

Pseudocode:
Minutes in decade-
Minutes in hour
Hours in day
Days in Year
Years in Decade

```ruby
Minutes_in_decade = 60*24*365*10
puts 60*24*365*10
```

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

I'm not sure exactly what this question is asking. In terms of syntax, Ruby uses:

```
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division

```

What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers are whole numbers, no decimal points. Floats are numbers that have decimal points, even if they are tradtionally "whole," they always have a decimal.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

Integer division rounds down in case of a remainder, keeping the numbers whole integers. Floats are used when you want the remainder counted.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
A string is a type of variable. It is a way to use variables other than numbers, particularly words.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

A local variable is a variable defined within a set of code. They are used when you want to assign particular values to the variables specified. They are specific to the code in which you are working, where you define them yourself.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

This challenge was pretty easy. It took some playing with to get the tests right, but it was mostly a matter of where I was putting the code in the doc, and once I figured out where it needed to go, everything was fine. It was a good refresher, mainly for a lot of the object-oriented language vernacular. I'm excited to get to play a bit more with Ruby, and I liked this way of practicing much more than working with something like CodeAcademy.
