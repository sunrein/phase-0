###What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a diagram of what you want your website layout to look like. It is a visual representation of the general design, including the placement of headers, footers, and site navigation. This is a step in brainstorming the site's later, more sophisticated design and code.

###What are the benefits of wireframing?

Before you start coding, you have a better sense of what the end product will be, which will help when designing and coding later. This is a way of figuring out not only where you want things to go, but what you want the main components of the website to be.

###Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I found wireframing to be a bit frustrating because I had never done it before. I am sure it will get easier and more comprehensive with practice, but I feel like I had no real reference for what my page should look like, or what comprehensive design is. While I feel like what I created is fine for now, I think it could be much improved. I'm sure the purpose is just to get me to do it myself, but I wish I had an example of a template or a better sense of what it should look like.

###Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I did some minor tweaks to my wireframe, but in general, I didn't really know what I was doing or what it will end up looking like. I might want to revise my wireframe or later design down the line after looking at some website references for ideas on what more comprehensive design looks like.

###What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

My main questions involved what software to use and whether or not I was making something that would be considered "good design." I did a lot of Googling to find free software and ended up using Gliffy because the link provided by DBC seemed outdated. I also looked at a few blogs that I follow just to see what their general layout was for inspiration. However, as I should have expected, those designs were much more complex and I ended up sticking to my own basic structure.

###Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I found the wireframing to be helpful and fun, but also a bit tedious because I felt relatively directionless in its creation. I knew what components to add, but having no experience with this, I probably overthought the challenge. Also, in the future I hope that DBC includes better resources for wireframing apps, because the ones provided in the link were sometimes unavailiable or expensive. I really liked using Gliffy, and when I have a better understanding of design, I think it could be a fun tool to play with. In general I think wireframing is a good tactic for me because it helps me visualize the end product more than a page of code does (at least at this point).
