###What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The six phases are:
1) Information gathering
2) Planning
3) Design
4) Development
5) Testing & Delivery
6) Maintenance

###What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal of my website is to promote myself to future potential employers. In order to do this, it will include basic information about me, such as my social media links on Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub, as well as contact information and a picture of me. It will also include important information such as previous projects of mine and my blog, which will serve as my portolio for future employers.

###What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience are future employers. Therefore, I want the website to present myself in a professional way. I want demonstrate my capabilities as a developer for them to see my skills, as well as to see how I use my blog to explain concepts I've learned. I also want it to be easy for them to contact me in case they are interested in me as a future employee.

###What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I think the primary action of my website is for developers to not only see my portfolio, but also make it easy to contact me. If the design makes it difficult to find these two crucial pieces of information, the employer may lose interest in my website quickly.

###What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

One of the key facets to desgin is usability, and ease of use for the user. If the user experience (UX) is unpleasant, users are not likely to remain on a site or return to it. Design is about looking nice, but more than that it is about ease of use, and the two do not need to be mutually exclusive. This includes catering to the visually impared, those using different kinds of devices to access your interface, and features that inhance UX such as interactivity. Design is all about UX, which can be greatly inhanced or inhibited by design alone. 

###What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience design is catering to the user and designing with the user in mind, rather than what the creator thinks the user should want. UX design means listening to user response, seeing what makes users happy when they are on your website, and changing things to make the website easier and more accessible for the user. The more websites there are, the more competition there is on the web, so having a UX desgined website is crucial in maintaining a usership.

###Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I had some trouble figuring out how to use Markdown. This is something that I've never heard of before, and I found the website link provided did not adequately explain how it is to be used and what each part of the code meant. It took some troubleshooting of my own, as well as some tweaking both in my textfile and later on GitHub to get my image to display properly, but I couldn't figure out why it started working and why it wasn't working before. I could tell from Slack that others had similar issues in getting this to work and figuring out how and why it does/doesn't. I still don't have a grasp on Markdown, which I find frustrating and a bit tedious.
