		<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Having somewhat of a prior knowledge to HTML, I found this rather easy. I figured the easiest way to accomplish this would be to make an unordered list, rather than a table. It was sometimes hard to remember the tags and the order in which they go, just because Code Academy walks you through every step of the way and doesn't require you to really memorize the syntax of the language you're learning. So, while I had to refer to my HTML tags cheat sheet a few times, it seemed relatively easy.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I'm still not entirey sure if I am using relative paths correctly, and the research I've done hasn't really clarified my confusion, but it seems to be working for now and that's all I can really hope for. Other than that, I think using semantic HTML5 is relatively easy, and there are a lot of helpful resources out there that make it even easier.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Seeing as that I don't really know how to format or style in HTML, it was pretty easy to avoid trying. I skipped those sections in Code Academy as prompted, so I wouldn't know how to make it look prettier, even if I tried. It is kind of hard to make something that looks so bare bones, but I expect that it will be looking much nicer soon.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML is good for structure. It feels sort of like making a draft for the eventual page, like a more code based version of wireframing, just to get some stuff on the page. However, that seems to be its only main use, considering it isn't used at all in formatting and making the site look pretty. HTML is also very simple to use, so I understand why we are learning it first; not only for structural purposes, but also because it is very quick to learn.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I seemed to forget to close tags more often than I thought I would, which was my main problem. I just need to make sure my nested tags are staggered in a way that it is easy to check whether or not they are closed. Also, I figure it will take awhile to memorize all of the tags I need, so I find myself saying what the tag abbreviations stand for in my head while I type. For instance, I think "unordered list" when typing "ul." It just helps to cement what I'm doing and why, and hopefully I will eventually learn how to use the tags intuitively.
