### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository:

https://github.com/sunrein/sunrein.github.io

### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Go to GitHub. In the upper righthand corner of the main page, there should be a + button. Click this and then click "new repository." Name the repository and set the license settings to MIT.

To clone a repository, go to the terminal. Create a new branch in the repository directory using git checkout -b "branch name". Back on GitHub, find the repository clone link on the page of the new repository, which should be on the lower right-hand side. From there, type "git clone" and paste the repo clone link here. The repository should be cloned!

### Describe what open source means.

Open source means that legally, other people are allowed to use, change, and manipulate code that you created for their own projects with almost no restrictions. This is key when people are contributing to massive projects without worrying about who has the rights to control and change the files and who doesn't.

### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open Source is cool, but I don't think I would go as far as to say it is a utopian idea. It in some ways does make me feel nervous, but the fact that we are willing to trust our work to others does make me happy. I just hope that it doesn't get abused, which it probably does all of the time because of the nature of the Internet. Open Source definitely makes things easier for people just getting started with code, and its inherently free nature is probably a more welcoming environment to enter into than a restrictive and protective one.

### Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are very important. Most broadly, they protect your work. This is important seeing as developers are creators, and but a lot of work into what they do. They should have the right to choose how accessible and shareable they want their work to be, so I think it will be very important in the future to understand how licesnes work and the different limitations and allowences of various licenses. You probably don't want every piece of code out in the world to be open source.

### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I found this challenge to be relatively straightforward. While I have not memorized all of the git syntax yet, it is making more sense to me and getting easier every day. I did have to refer to lesson 1.5 a few times just to make sure I was doing the right steps in the right order, but overall, I found this challenge to be one of the easiest yet, because it honestly just built off of previous challenges in a very intuitive way. It felt good to make a new repository and complete a pull request in a matter of minutes, whereas the previous challenge took a couple of hours to master.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I did not. I found this challenge to be well explained and I did not feel the need to explore any outside resources.
