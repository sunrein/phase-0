## 1.1 Thinking About Time Reflection

I briefly reviewed all of the links given, but focused on the ones that made the most sense to me and the way my brain works. Specifically, they were the Fogg Method, meditation, and the Pomodoro method/time boxing.

Time boxing is an interesting method because it makes work focused on the time period you are working rather than trying to accomplish a goal. Of course, you are working toward a goal, or several, while in the time frame, but you also take time to assess how long things are going to take and give yourself space in between time boxes for rest and reflection. I think that this, particularly the Pomodoro method, will be helpful for me in DBC, because it forces you to break tasks up into smaller, more digestible chunks, rather than working for hours on end, which is probably unsustainable.

I also think that this way of working will help with time management, because I do not have a current work structure. In college, I was always a procrastinator, but I realize that my way of working was really ineffective and really exhausting. I also find stress to be motivating, but also triggering to my anxiety, so meditation will probably help. Also, I never knew that meditation had so many benefits for the brain, so I'm excited to give it a try. This, coupled with time boxing and the Fogg method (specifically focusing on small victories), will help me establish a work routine that is productive and sustainable, and also will help keep the work fun rather than more stressful and overwhelming. I think establishing a routine in the first weeks of Phase 0 will help keep me on track and organized, and I love being organized.


## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is an interface that allows you to access the operating system. Bash is a language that allows you to navigate and control this interface.

The most challenging part of this lesson was using the terminal itself and figuring out how it works. I've never used the terminal before, so it felt intimidating and completely foreign at the start, and looked different from any coding I've done in the past. However, once I understood the functionality of each command, it was relatively easy to use. I was able to successfully use each command.

Some of the most helpful commands are pwd and ls, because they help you navigate where you are and where you can go within a directory. It helps you keep track of where you are and where you're going, and if you work backwards, you can also figure out how you got there. Similarly, help is useful to know because it gives you a list of commands, so as long as you understand how to use the terminal, the help command can remind you of syntax.

- pwd prints the working directory, or the current folder you are in
- ls prints the files within the current directory
- mv moves or renames a text file
- cd allows you to access a directory/folder within your current directory
- ../ takes you one step back out of your current directory, to the directory/folder in which it is contained
- touch creates a new blank text file
- mkdir creates a new folder within your current directory
- less prints the contents of a text file to the terminal
- rmdir deletes a folder in the current directory
- rm deletes a text file
- help prints available commands to use in the terminal as well as their functionalities

## 1.4 Create, Fork, and Clone Reflection

To create a new repository, go to GitHub. In the upper right hand corner, click on the plus icon and select New Repository. Here, you can name the repository and set the privacy settings.

To fork a repo, go to the repo page of the repo that you want to fork. On the upper righthand side of the page, there should be a fork button. Click the button and select the account to which you want the repository forked. You should now be on the forked repo page. In order to clone this repo, find the clone HTTPS url on the lower righthand side of the screen. Copy this url, open terminal, and type "git clone" and paste the URL clone here. It should be cloned!

You fork repositories in order to access and modify preexisting files without modifying the original files. This is useful when you are not collaborating directly with the creators of the repo, but you still want to be able to play around with and modify copies of their files. When you create a repository, you are starting from scratch, but when you fork, you have access to copies of the files of a different repo.

I find git and GitHub to be relatively intuitive. The instructions provided here were clear and concise, and I can easily clone and fork repositories. My main confusion at the beginning of Phase 0 was the difference between git and GitHub, but that was easily clarified and I do not think I have any problems with either of these things at this point.
