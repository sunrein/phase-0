# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
# .select - searches within the hash/array and pulls them out if they are indeed there. This method is applied to the source (hash/array)
# include? -  searches a hash/array to evaluate if it includes what you are looking for. This technically is evaluated as a boolean.
#.keys - returns the keys that are associated with the requested values, is pretty self-explanitory to use

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
