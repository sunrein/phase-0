<!-- 
What did you learn about the DOM?

Well, most importantly, I learned what the DOM is and what it is used for. I'm getting a better sense of when you would use JS and incorporate it into an HTML document. I definitely need more practice because some of the steps didn't make 100% sense, but overall I think the important takeaway is what the DOM is.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

document.getElementbyID or document.getElementByClassName are helpful when trying to "grab" a certain section of the HTML to modify. We also learned that you can loop through an element in the DOM, which is interesting and adds a layer of complexity I wasn't anticipating in this challenge.
