// Person 2 - Sabrina Unrein
// Pseudocode:

// 1)
// Input: an array
// Output: sum of the numbers in the array

// Steps:
// Create a FUNCTION called SUM which accepts an ARGUMENT of an ARRAY. 
// The function should be able to add all of the numbers together regardless of the size of the array, so the function should LOOP through the array to add all of the elements together, using a COUNTER and a FOR LOOP.
// This function should RETURN the sum of the array.

// 2)
// Input: an array
// Output: the mean of the elements in the array

// Steps:
// Create a FUNCTION called MEAN. This function accepts an ARRAY as an argument. 
// Create a LOOP that will add all of the numbers contained within the array together, much like in previous SUM FUNCTION
// Take the SUM and DIVIDE it by the number of objects within the array to find the AVERAGE of the array.
// RETURN the average of the array

//3)
//Input: An array
//Output: The median of the array

// Steps:
// Create a FUNCTION called MEDIAN. This function accepts and ARRAY as an argument.
// SORT the ARRAY so that the values within the array are in numerical order
// Create a VARIABLE(half) that is the result of the LENGTH of the ARRAY DIVIDED by TWO. This represents halfway point in the array BY INDEX, where the median will be. Should use Math.floor to round the value down (so no decimals).
// IF array length MODULUS 2 == 0, find the AVERAGE of the half variable and the half variable -1. The average of these two numbers is the median. RETURN this value.
// IF array length MODULUS 2 != 0, the length of the array is odd, so the median is the middle value, represented by the halfway point variable. RETURN the value in the array that is at the halfway point (via the half variable).
